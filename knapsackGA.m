function knapsackGA
%% The knapsack problem
% The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization:
% Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the count of each
% item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a
% given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from 
% the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must 
% fill it with the most useful items.
% 
% The problem often arises in resource allocation with financial constraints. A
% similar problem also appears in combinatorics, complexity theory, cryptography and
% applied mathematics.
% 
% The decision problem form of the knapsack problem is the question "can a value of
% at least V be achieved without exceeding the weight W?"

% items of the first kind but not 5.2222 items.
